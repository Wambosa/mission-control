// most-connected modules"), and is queried on demand by the agent via MCP.
//
// Kept framework-free so the server (indexer/repo/service), the renderer (api
// client / RecallPanel), and the standalone bundled MCP script can all import
// it without pulling in the DB or React layers. Mirrors the conventions of
