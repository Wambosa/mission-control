 * Mission Pet line packs. Tone: dry terminal-nerd humor — short, wry, never

 * sarcastic, wisdom = practical/insightful, chaos = absurdist, zen =
 * calm/patient); an unweighted line is neutral and available to every pet.
 * Heavily-weighted lines (3) act as personality "overrides" — a maxed stat
 * makes them dominate that trigger.

 * binkies, chick peeps, cub dozes, lotl encourages, rivet reports in ALL
 * CAPS, trundle takes the long view, ember burns with reborn intensity.
 * They never leak to other species.
